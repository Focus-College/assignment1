    This is all about my quest to become a computer programmer as an adult. So far I am taking first year of the advance software development program.
    I hope to continue with second year to get my diploma in this. So far in the course we have coverd; Computer System fundamentals, System 
    development- User centerd desighn and developing software introduction. Many skills have been introduced for web applications and understanding 
    the way our computers work. The system development class was one of my favourites, we were introduced to the understanding of a basic web page.
    most of the tasks were completed using AdobeXD. The outcome of the class was to have the ability to confidently use AdobeXD to produce a working 
    web page. We gained expereince in creating logos, headers and footers, as well as including .gif files and maps. This class made me confident in using 
    the program to produce both a web page as well as a android or apple based application. 
    Computer Systems fundament was interesting to learn about the component side of how our computers work. We went into all the fine details on all the 
    compnents. The areas that I found most interesting was learning about binary, what a usless thing to know beyond it is really interesting. That was 
    possibly my faveourite component of the class, as well I enjoyed learning about paging. Brought me back to when I was a young teen wanting my computer
    to work better and I tried clocking it. 
    <br>
    As well I have recently completed the introduction to software development, this maybe one of the most interesting classes so far. I loved learning 
    about java script as well as learning how to use Ubuntu, Github, and the Node.js package with Yargs, Chi, Mocha and such. I made some projects in class 
    for a contracting company, check out my GitHub to see the stuff. We also included TypeScript in this class and really found it fun to make a small 
    web application using these tools. Also found out through this that this course is 100% worth all the hard work and that the pay off can be rewarding,
    just gotta keep plowing through all the code.
