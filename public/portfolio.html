                            <p>
                                "Geralds Construction Application" Version 2.0.0 is a fairly basic CLI applicaiton. In this application the
                                goal was to take in two parameters(the length and width of a house). With these two parameters the application 
                                needed to return the nimber of 2x4'x and 4x4'x needed to stick frame a House.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This Project had a lot of new information for me, and being about to implement it in the application successfully
                                taught me a lot! The language used was <strong>Typescript</strong>, and I also used a new to me npm package called yargs. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                "Geralds Construction Application" Version 3.0.0 build on the previous version of the build. In this version, you 
                                are able to run two commands. (calc-wood-needed), and (find-house).  To use the <strong>calc-wood-needed</strong> command you will need four parameteres.
                                The Length of the House, the Width of the House, the Unit of measurement you will be using, and the Name for the House. This command
                                will then calculate the number 2x4's and 4x4's needed for the build, and save the house under the name you gave it. 
                                The <strong>find-house</strong> command only takes one parameter, the Name of the house you are looking for! Once 
                                executed this command will look through the saved houses and find the one you are looking for. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This iteration of the Project had even more new information for me. The ability to save and look up houses, as well as a few 
                                new npm packages such as eslint, and prettier.

                                "Geralds Construction Applicaiton" Version 4.0.0 build on the previous version again. In this verison, you have all 
                                the functionality that we had before, but with a few new scripts that you can run with npm. The focus of the stage 
                                of the project was writting the scripts. There are a total of eight that you can run! For a full list of the commands

                            <p>"Geralds Construction Applicaiton" Version 5.0.0 is the final version of the project! Here we have all the functionality
                            that was in the previous versions, plus some new features! One of the new features include the ability to recall saved houses
                            WITH all of the information that was stored with them(in the previous versions it would only show the house name)!

                                In this version of the project everything that we learnt in the <strong>Intro to Software Development</strong> came
                                together. We had to impement complex interfaces, and hook everything up behind the scenes so that everything ran smoothly!

                            <h2>YelpCamp</h2>
                            <p>YelpCamp is a project that I worked on in a Udemy class for web-development. This web application had a ton of new functionality
                                for me to inplement.  YelpCamp is similar to Yelp, where useres are able to leave reviews and get information on different businesses.
                                Except in this case, it is made for campsites!  YelpCamp uses passport.js to Sign-up or log users in. Once you are logged in you are 
                                able to upload your own campsites, and also leave reviews on campsites.  YelpCamp also had restrictions, where you 
                                must be logged in to an account before you are able to leave reviews, or enter a new campsite, although you are able
                                to view existing reviews and campsites without being logged in!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I do not have YelpCamp online to view YET as it was created with GoormIDE, but I will have it uploaded soon so you can take a look!!
