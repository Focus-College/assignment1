          <h1>Geralds Contracting v2</h1>
          <p>The contractor was happy with the outcome however his clients started requesting
            larger houses with required new specifications.</p>
          <p>At this point, I had started fresh and wrote everything from scratch</p>

          <h1>Geralds Contracting v3</h1>
          <p>The contractor now wanted to recall previous clients as well as add new clients</p>
          <p>The contractor can also input dimensions without a client which will not save the outcome.</p>
