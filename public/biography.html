          <h1>My Biography</h1>
          <p>
            Although my experience with coding itself is limited, I'm working my way through school in hopes
            of having a career in Software Development upon completition. Some of my work so far is displayed 
            on the Portfolio page.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've always had an interest in Software Development but have never made the initial push until an opportunity
            came up during the Covid19 Pandemic. Before starting school i've played around with computers/games for the most 
            part of my life.

            When I was in my teenage years; I spent a considerable amount of time taking apart Xbox Gen1 consoles so 
            that I could Modify game structures. All of the software was already developed however it helped build
            my personality into a semi-nerd.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since joining the workforce of life, I quickly realized I hate working for other people. As I personally think
            Software Development could be something I'm great at with enough practice it could possibly allow myself to work 
            for myself once my skills are sufficent. I have a lot of application ideas that I believe are currently lacking
            in the app world.
