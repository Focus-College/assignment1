                          Hi there! My name is Colby Boettcher. I am 27 years old, and an aspiring, 
                          mostly self-taught developer located in the beautiful Okanagan Valley! 
                          I have a beautiful wife, and daughter, who are my whole world. I have been
                           teaching myself programming for about 2 years now using online resources, 
                           such as Udemy, and I am currently enrolled in a Software Development 
                           Couse offered by Focus College. I hope this will allow me to break through 
                           into a new career in Software Development! The main reason that I would love
                            to pursue a programming career is because I love a challenge. In the career 
                            field I am currently in, I do not feel as though I am being challenged, and 
                            this causes restlessness! Programming offers a change to be mentally stimulated 
                            with new problems every day! Something else that draws me to development is 
                            that the field is ever changing. As a developer you must be willing to embrace 
                            and learn new technologies; which is very appealing to me! Even though programming 
                            is a passion and hobby of mine, there are other things that I enjoy to do in my free time. 
                            Some of these things include Leather Working, Spending time with my family, and 
                            enjoying the great outdoor! Find more information about my Interests by clicking
