                        <h2>Camping</h2>
                        <p>What could be better than a day filled with exploring the woods, an evening of good conversation (and ghost stories!) surrounded by loved ones around a campfire, 
                            and a night of sleeping in a tent beneath a pitch-black sky filled with bright stars? Nothing! Thats why any time I get the opertunity to get out into the woods I take it!
                            Camping is more than just an interest, it is a way to get back in touch with nature, and your inner self. There is 
                            nothing that is more peaceful, than waking up in a tent, in the middle of nowhere!

                        <h2>Family Time</h2>
                        <p>I love my family more than anything. Last summer my wife and I welcomed a beautiful baby girl into the world. Ever since then
                            the term "Family Time" has taken on a new meaning for me. There is nothing more enjoyable than a peaceful night with my wife and 
                            daughter!

                        <h2>Leather Working</h2>
                        <p>There is something special about buiding something with your own two hands. Leather Crafting allows you to express yourself in a new and 
                            interesting way. With the options for projects as unlimited as your imagination. I have only been leatherworking for just over a year now, 
                            but I have come a long ways since I started, and isnt that what it is all about!?

                        <h2>Coding</h2>
                        <p>ALthough I want to start a career with development, coding is so much more than just a job for me! If I am not doing one of the other things listed
                            in my interests page here, then odds are im coding. I love the challenges, and the high you feel when you overcome that obsticle that has been in your 
                            way for the last few hours, or days. Similar to leatherworking, coding allows you to express you creativity in new and exciting ways! Never stop leaning, 
                            never stop growing!

                        <h2>Dirt Biking</h2>
                        <p>Sometimes you need to just get out and go for a rip! Dirt Biking is a great way to get out in the woods, and just forget about
                            whatever is worrying you. It also gives you a unique perspective when your traveling on the trails, watching natures beauty pass
                            you by. 10/10 Would reccomend giving it a try!
